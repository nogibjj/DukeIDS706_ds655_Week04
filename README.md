# This is a Python repository to test runs across different versions of Python 

  - Status badge for default python version: [![Python CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/DukeIDS706_ds655_Week04/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/DukeIDS706_ds655_Week04/actions/workflows/main.yml)


  - Status badge for Multiple python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.11): [![Multiple Python Versions](https://github.com/nogibjj/DukeIDS706_ds655_Week04/actions/workflows/matrix.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/DukeIDS706_ds655_Week04/actions/workflows/matrix.yml)


Files in this repository include:


## 1. Readme
  The `README.md` file is a markdown file that contains basic information about the repository, what files it contains, and how to consume them


## 2. Requirements
  The `requirements.txt` file has a list of packages to be installed for any required project. Currently, my requirements file contains some basic python packages.


## 3. Codes
  This folder contains all the code files used in this repository - the files named "Test_" will be used for testing and the remaining will define certain functions


## 4. Resources
  -  This folder contains any other files relevant to this project. Currently, I have added -
  - `Iris_Data.csv` - a csv file containing the Iris dataset for test purposes
  - `plot image.png` - a png file containing a plot of the Iris dataset generated automatically by the `Pandas_Plot.py` code
  - `plot image Jupyter.png` - a png file containing a plot of the Iris dataset generated automatically by the `Python_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb` code


## 5. CI/CD Automation Files


  ### 5(a). Makefile
  The `Makefile` contains instructions for installing packages (specified in `requirements.txt`), formatting the code (using black formatting), testing the code (running all the sample python code files starting with the term *'test...'* ), and linting the code using pylint


  ### 5(b). Github Actions
    - Github Actions uses the `main.yml` file to call the functions defined in the Makefile based on triggers such as push or pull. Currently, every time a change is pushed onto the repository, it runs the install packages, formatting the code, linting the code, and then testing the code functions. the status badge for this file is at the top of this README file

    - The folder also has a `matrix.yml` file that runs the same tests on multiple python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.11) to ensure that the code is compatible with all versions of python. The status badge for this file is at the top of this README file


  ### 5(c). Devcontainer
  The `.devcontainer` folder mainly contains two files - 
    * `Dockerfile` defines the environment variables - essentially it ensures that all collaborators using the repository are working on the same environment to avoid conflicts and version mismatch issues
    * `devcontainer.json` is a json file that specifies the environment variables including the installed extensions in the virtual environment
